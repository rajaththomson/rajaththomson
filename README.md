## About Me 🕵️

From the land of spices and space missions, now navigating the foggy realms of AI in the UK. I'm Mathew - who codes by day and dreams in Malayalam by night. As a Data Scientist trapped in a Sherlock Holmes novel, my days consist of solving mysteries hidden within datasets, sipping tea, and occasionally debating whether Python is indeed named after the snake or the comedy group. Spoiler: It's the latter, which clearly explains my coding style - efficient with a touch of unexpected humor. 
## 🛠 Technical Tinkerings

Here's my arsenal, not including the kettle for my tea:

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python (loves a good Python joke), SQL (Structured Query Laughter), PyTorch, TensorFlow (as stretchy as freshly made chappatis)
- **Tools & Platforms**: AWS (Absolutely Wonderful Service), Google Cloud (for when London's cloudy weather isn't enough), Docker (ships data faster than the Royal Mail)
- **Data Analysis & Visualisations**: Pandas (not the bear), NumPy (number of pies?), Matplotlib, Seaborn (see less, do more)

## 🎓 Educational Escapades

- **MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science** - Learned how to make computers smart, still working on humans.
- **PG Diploma in Management (International Business)** - Because managing data wasn’t enough, I decided to manage businesses too.
- **BEng in Computer Science** - Where I learned that computers sometimes do what you tell them to.
